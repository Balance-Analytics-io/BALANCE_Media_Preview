## Pool Landscape Updates

**(4/30/23 Epoch 409 -> 5/15/23 Epoch 411)**
**More New Multi-Pools, Big Binance Stake Drop, NEW GIRL Gone?, Staked Ada Dropping**

Welcome back to the BALANCE Stake Pool Landscape Report. Here's the big macro picture of what has changed.

### Fifteen (15) New Pools have been Created - ~50% are MPOs

Since the last report (April 30th), fifteen (15) new pools have been created.

- Over 50% of the new pools created (this round) are part of Multi-Pool Operations (MPOs).
  - WAVE added 1 new pool(s).
  - KID added 2 new pools.
  - MS added 1 new pool.
  - BD added 1 new pool.
  - New pool group SIMBA with 3 pools - same DNS used for relays.

### Huge Binance Stake Drop by 55% (1.57BAda)!

There was a significant drop in the Binance group stake, 1.57 Billion (yes, with a B) Ada, resulting in a decrease of 55% of their Live Stake - That's huge!

- Where did the Ada go? Maybe some wallet sleuths can help. Are they positioning for SEC crackdowns or selling to cover costs?
- K-effective impacts and MAV increased significantly, see for yourself! MAV is now 27.

See for yourself. Here's a demo of searching for Binance Group and seeing the change from the last 10ish Epochs:

{% video src="binance_stake_v_lev_demo.mov" %}

Here's a demo of seeing the increase in MAV and K-Effective! What's good to see is the K-Effective, a weighted measure of the pool groups, increasing rapidly. The only question remaining, where is the stake going?

### NEW GIRL dead? (335MAda Private Pool, all pledge, 100% margin)

In Epoch 411's analysis, it was very interesting to see the NEW GIRL private pool group's Live Stake effectively dropped to zero.

- In the Epoch 411 analysis, it's interesting to see NEW GIRL attempt to respawn under different POOL IDs.
- ADA was moved through the same stake address within minutes through the same utility.
- Given this finding, the NEW GIRL pool group is re-established using the new pool hash ID values. It appears that new pool IDs and new addresses are being used.
- Even if the funds were indeed a change in ownership, we still believe this to be a legitimate Multi-Pool Operation.

## Topic: Staked Ada Down, Impacts of DeFi and Memecoin Craze? ‚Ä¶ or is it Something More?

We have observed a consistent decline in Staked Ada, which warrents a bit of investigation: Why?

{% img src="decline_staked_ada.png" alt="decline_staked_ada" %}
*Source: [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/p_wxcw6g0irc)*

We tweeted and asked the Cardano Community what they thought. [Marco](https://twitter.com/MarcoMeerman) graciously added DeFi is the culprit.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ADA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ADA</a> going into DeFi.</p>&mdash; M‚Ç≥rco Meerm‚Ç≥n (@MarcoMeerman) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcoMeerman/status/1656018934703824919?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### Influence of DeFi on Staked Ada

This raises the question: Is it a result of the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and Memecoin frenzy causing less Ada to be staked, or is there something more to the story? 

DeFi on Cardano is definitely gaining momentum, and you know the memecoin craze is absolutely wild right now.

Checking DeFiLama the Cardano TVL is definitley on the rise.

{% img src="defilama_tvl_ada.png" alt="defilama_tvl_ada" %}
*Source: [DeFiLama](https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano?tvl=true)*

From the Year-To-Date bottom of the curve, the TVL increased by ~95MAda or +190%.

While it's positive to see the blockchain being utilized for DeFi, we must ensure that the staked Ada doesn't decrease too much. Staked Ada serves as a defense mechanism against Sybil attacks, providing security to our blockchain through staking instead of relying solely on hash.

Our friend [@LiberLion](https://twitter.com/liberlion17/status/1649374245959376899?s=20) has expressed concerns about the trend if DeFi offers higher yields than staking, will the Staked Ada decrease, and thus decrease network security?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Much of the consensus staking goes to DeFi. <br>We see the increase in TVL.<br><br>I see a problem here. I saw it before, too. <br>I wrote this article 2 years ago:<br>&#39;Stake Pools vs. Liquidity Pools&#39;<a href="https://t.co/ASfhdGQHug">https://t.co/ASfhdGQHug</a> <a href="https://t.co/ty2hLEnnc9">https://t.co/ty2hLEnnc9</a></p>&mdash; Li‚ÇøŒµ ÅLi√∏Œ∑ (@liberlion17) <a href="https://twitter.com/liberlion17/status/1649374245959376899?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A recent realworld example of liquidity flocking to higher yields is the Apple High Interest Yield Savings Account. High yield has a magnetic effect for sure.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple‚Äôs, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AAPL&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$AAPL</a>, new high yield savings account brought in as much as $990 million in deposits over its first four days, per Forbes.</p>&mdash; unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) <a href="https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1656328492689104900?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### Hidden Surprise: Big Group Stake Moves to the Downside

However, upon checking how much total ada was unstaked even recently, DeFi TVL seems to be only a fraction of the impact.

Well, you may be surprised to find there has been a significant decline in stake from four (4) major pool groups, including Binance!

The first clue was the significant sudden drops in staking as seen in the image below:

{% img src="decline_staked_ada.png" alt="decline_staked_ada" %}
*Source: [Cardano Blockchain Insights](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/3136c55b-635e-4f46-8e4b-b8ab54f2d460/page/p_wxcw6g0irc)*

The most significant drops in staking occurred on the following dates:
- April 5th, Epoch 403 to 404 - BCSH and New Guy experienced significant changes.
- April 20th, Epoch 406 to 407 - Binance witnessed a substantial drop.
- May 3rd, Epoch 409 - Binance experienced another decrease.

According to a tweet by M‚Ç≥rco Meerm‚Ç≥n, Ada is flowing into DeFi. Adverse News also reported a decrease of 105MAda due to DeFi.

However, this drop is not even close to the speculated 35% unstaked (billion?). It's worth considering real-world examples, such as how high-interest savings accounts offered by Apple can pull funds from small to mid-regional banks. Money talks.

Another tweet by unusual_whales mentions Apple's new high-yield savings account, which accumulated nearly $990 million in deposits over four days. This highlights the influence money can have on financial decisions.




## Single Pool Spotlight: TERM and COSD

We would like to give kudos to two outstanding community members who have been diligently contributing to CIPS, Cardano Forums, and the Cardano Professional Society in the Matrix. Both are extremely erudite, steadfast, and kind. Additionally, their stake pools are shining examples of good actors in the landscape.

Thank you both for all that you do. Please check out their stake pools:

## What We‚Äôre Paying Attention To

- Cardano Foundation SPO On-Chain Poll for Stake Pool Reward Sharing Scheme (RSS) Parameters.
  - A lot of rekindled discussion on twitter.
  - What do you think will happen? Pro tip: watch the Coinbase stake pools for the answer.

- Djed reserve ratio has been under 400%, 360% on 5/8/23 - does this have any staked ADA impacts? Is SHEN Staked yet?

## BALANCE Updates

- We are in the trenches, working on more charts. The Svelte + D3 learning curve is steep, and there are few open-source references, but once we overcome this hurdle, we should be able to create charts more efficiently.
- The Public Pool Group API is starting to receive hits, which is a positive growth metric!
