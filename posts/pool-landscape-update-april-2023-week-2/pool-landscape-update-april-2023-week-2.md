# Pool Landscape Update - April 2023 Week 2

## Table of Contents

------------

## Introduction
Welcome to BALANCE's Pool Landscape Update Article, a series that will cover the Cardano Stake Pool ecosystem of events and noteable changes. We will focus on pool groups and decentralization, but will of course cover any significant events to keep the Cardano Community aprised with the best pool and chain intelligence. 

We strive to remain unbias, and will bring just the facts to the table.  However, we will remain vigilant watchdogs and call out any actions to improve network security.

This is the first of many articles, enjoy! Be sure to try the Table of Contents hotlinks if you want to skip around.

## Big Picture Coverage of Epoch 370 to 405 (10/17/22-4/10/22)
We'd be remiss if we didn't cover the big picture at a high level of the stake pool action over the last few months, which saw significant pool activity and movement from what appears to be the SEC crack down (off-chain attacks if you will) on exchanges and staking services. Here's a brief timeline of significant events:

### SEC Rumors and Crackdown Timeline
- Feb 8, 2023 [Epoch 392], [Brian Armstrong Tweet](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1623459203150131201?s=20)
    > "1/ We're hearing rumors that the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers. I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen."
- Feb 9, 2023 [Epoch 393], [Kraken to end on-chain staking services for U.S. clients](https://blog.kraken.com/post/17619/settlement/)
    > "Kraken has agreed to end its on-chain staking services for U.S. clients. Starting today, Kraken will automatically unstake all U.S. client assets enrolled in the on-chain staking program."
- Feb 17, 2023 [Epoch 394], [Bloomberg Report: Binance Considers Pulling Back From US Partners as Crypto Crackdown Escalates](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-17/binance-holdings-explores-retreat-from-the-us-as-crypto-crackdown-escalates?leadSource=uverify%20wall)
    > ""We pulled back on some potential investments, or bids on bankrupt companies in the U.S. for now. Seek permission first,‚Äù Zhao said in another tweet."
- March 22, 2023 [Epoch 401], [Coinbase Blog: We asked the SEC for reasonable crypto rules for Americans. We got legal threats instead.](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/we-asked-the-sec-for-reasonable-crypto-rules-for-americans-we-got-legal)
    > "Today, we are disappointed to share that the SEC gave us a ‚ÄúWells notice‚Äù regarding an unspecified portion of our listed digital assets, **our staking service Coinbase Earn**, Coinbase Prime, and Coinbase Wallet after a cursory investigation. A Wells notice is the way that SEC staff tells a company that they are recommending that the SEC take enforcement action for possible violations of securities laws. It is not a formal charge or lawsuit, but it can lead to one. Rest assured, Coinbase products and services continue to **operate as usual** - today‚Äôs news does not require any changes to our current products or services." (bold text added by BALANCE)

### NUFI0 Whale Oversaturation Attack?
ADALITE, NUFI0, Epoch 402 multi wallet whale moves 6 sets of 50MAda and 1 13MAda, could be the same entity, April 11 2023. 2 Days later the whales migrated to other NuFi pools. They are likely NuFi or VC wallets.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Err...you do know there&#39;s other pools right NUFI0? üëÄ<br><br>ADALITE pool group has added significant pledge and stake since epoch 370, look for yourself:<a href="https://t.co/MCxNeN5sJO">https://t.co/MCxNeN5sJO</a> <a href="https://t.co/r9vHUsNRhH">pic.twitter.com/r9vHUsNRhH</a></p>&mdash; BALANCE (@BalanceData22) <a href="https://twitter.com/BalanceData22/status/1645954409250328577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## What We're Watching Now
Here's what we are keeping an eye on.

### Exodus Launches Cardano Web3 Browser Wallet - Watch EVE Pool Group
On March 31st Exodus Wallet, a self-custody multi-chain wallet, [announced](https://www.exodus.com/web3-wallet/) they are launching a Cardano Web3 Browser Extension wallet. This is great news as they have a large user base. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are proud to announce that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cardano?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Cardano</a> is LIVE in the Exodus <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Web3</a> Wallet!<br><br>‚úÖ Connect to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NFT</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DeFi</a> dApps!<br>‚úÖ Manage <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ADA</a> Native Tokens &amp; CNFTs!<br>‚úÖ Cross-chain swaps!<br>‚úÖ Easy access to our 24/7 support team!<br><br>Download Exodus for Chrome &amp; Brave today! üëá<a href="https://t.co/vAnNTBqHgE">https://t.co/vAnNTBqHgE</a> <a href="https://t.co/Z7ZLreEeDT">pic.twitter.com/Z7ZLreEeDT</a></p>&mdash; Exodus - Crypto Wallet (@exodus_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/exodus_io/status/1641900795879649280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

What you may not be fully aware of though is that they utilize a 3rd party staking service [Everstake](https://everstake.one/cardano) who runs the pool group [EVE](https://cexplorer.io/groups/eve). Do a "ctrl+f" word search for "everstake" in [Exodus' support article on Cardano staking](https://www.exodus.com/support/article/1498-cardano-staking-faq).

In our [tweet](https://twitter.com/BalanceData22/status/1643038391498428416?s=20) we made aware that Exodus & Everstake [EVE] Pool Group have supported Cardano Staking since Sept 2021, early epoch 200s.

EVE runs 11 stake pools, combined 11k pledge, ~500MAda, and about 45,000x leverage factor. So far there have been no significant stake changes.

An option to choose your own stake pool would be great for advanced users in the Exodus web3 wallet, maybe we can mass request this feature.

### Luganodes [LGNS1] Potential to Multi-Pool
We have been watching these guys [Luganodes](https://www.luganodes.com/) who are another staking service provider based in the Swiss: "Secure staking by leading blockchain infrastructure provider". 

They currently run just one pool [LGNS1] with a pledge of 10 Ada, but let's see if they form a multi-pool operation. Their whole business is about running stake pools as a service so we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we see them spin up more when the market picks back up.

So far though they have a decent Cardano awareness and pretty decent [Cardano tweets](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aluganodes%20cardano&src=recent_search_click), so they aren't completely out of touch with the community.

The pool [LGNS1](https://pool.pm/0338d4f1c5e8ebee0689e22148c1483d411c5587d0ab986b8e824428/stake) looks like it has one huge wallet of 41M Ada (M Ada for Million Ada) with 86% majority stake that arrived in epoch 370. This is a new stake address, with [only previous delegation](https://cexplorer.io/stake/stake1u87mn7454dmezggnq6fy3j0fclh0e6zhsd7x5r6t0x4u3fc86730l/delegation#data) to [FKAI](https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool1mmrh2l3t5r7w5l7e82ven0e595vhgvu0hyf4ttrgcyejq8gwqcm) pool, who has a whooping 1.53 Ada met pledge (sarcasim alert). FKAI looks like it is currently inactive with 0% saturation now.  You can probably assume this 41M Ada is VC or Big Business money getting "professional" third party staking service. It makes you wonder, what is the driver to use these third party services and not community delegation?

## BALANCE Updates

### New Pool Group API Link now with Single Pool Group
We have made updates to the BALANCE Pool Group Data API, which now includes a **"SINGLEPOOL"** group!  This should be a very interesting new detail.  Please find the dataset here:
