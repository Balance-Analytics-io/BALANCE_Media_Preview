# Pool Landscape Report - April 2023 Week 4

## Table of Contents

## Pool Landscape Updates
**(4/16/23 Epoch 406 -> 4/30/23 Epoch 409)**

Single ITN Pools are spooling down, and multiple ISPO and Exchange pools are spooling up. 

Eighteen (18) new pools have been created since the last report about 2 weeks ago. Ten (10) of the new pools are from UPBIT, a Korean Crypto Exchange.

Newish Multi-pool KILN offering "Whitelabel Staking Service" is starting to gain significant stake from a pretty deep network of VC partners and Enterprise.

Of significant note is ITN Single Pool SOBIT with 45MAda announced they are closing. This will move a lot of stake, and hopefully to single pools which they recommened. 

But, watch out for ISPO Pools to gain traction soon and potentially attrack that delegation like moths to a flame.

### ITN Era Single Pools Closing: SOBIT & ADAGL
**An Ode to SOBIT and ADAGL**

SOBIT pool accounced they're retiring in 2 months. This is a huge blow as they have 45MAda in stake!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Because we can&#39;t keep up the usual quality of our stake pool service (mostly due to time constraints), we would like to announce the retirement of our pool with the 1st of July 2023.<br><br>We put some pool recommendations on our site: <a href="https://t.co/ECslQmnlUN">https://t.co/ECslQmnlUN</a></p>&mdash; SOBIT Pool - Retired on 1st of July! (@SOBITADA) <a href="https://twitter.com/SOBITADA/status/1630078397836566531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

[SOBITs](https://staking.outofbits.com/), or "Staking Out of Bit", was a verified ITN Single Stake Pool with significant contributions to Cardano. From their [website](https://staking.outofbits.com/), they were ardent supporters of single pool decentralization.

> “We are an independent and reliable stake pool for the Cardano blockchain from Austria, operated by IT professionals. We adhere to the principle of “one pool per operator” to support decentralization.”

Foruntately, they recommend a handful of other staples single stake pool, so hopefully their delegators are keen, and the re-delegation does not impact MAV. That kind of stake properly distributed to other pools could have an immediate impact on the MAV numbers.

So far scrolling [SOBIT on Pool.pm](https://pool.pm/cdae4a1a08974113e77ea332cb1da97d9e3fca5cf797f9394739214b), the stake seems to be evenly distributing to some pretty large high performance pools, but at least the stake is spreading out.

Also, [ADAGL](https://adaglobe.com/), or ADA Globe, [announced]() they are retiring at Epoch 408 with 500kAda of Stake:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi All,<br>This is to notify you that ADAGL pool will be retiring soon. Kindly delegate your stake to some other pool to continue earning staking rewards. Thanks to all delegators who helped us to maintain the pool for a long time.</p>&mdash; ADA Globe - Ticker : ADAGL (Retiring) (@GlobeAda) <a href="https://twitter.com/GlobeAda/status/1647243534200721410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Their website says they supported _"ITN and Mainnet Shelley Nodes"_, and at their height had about 17MAda Live Stake.

We thank **SOBIT and ADAGL** for their legendary contributions to get us this far in Cardano PoS.

Now enter the new players...

### KILN

[KILN](https://www.kiln.fi/) is another Staking-as-a-Service company based out of Paris Fance.  They have a pretty nice dashboard for "whitelabel staking" geared for Enteprise and VC Customers.

{img src="kiln_front_page.png" alt="kiln_front_page" %}

From their website they describe themselves as:
> "Enterprise-grade staking made easy. Stake your treasury directly, or bring staking to your users through our whitelabel product."

KILN started Ada Stake Pool Group in Epoch 358 of August of 2022, but the big money started really accumulating in Epoch 397 of March 2023 (See [KILN0](https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool10rdglgh4pzvkf936p2m669qzarr9dusrhmmz9nultm3uvq4eh5k)).

They opened four (4) pools, at the time of writing, with Live Stake of combined **257MAda, and 400Ada of pledge, with a total of 17 delegators**.

This yields a **Pool Group Leverage of 643,604x**.

No mention of Cardano in their [twitter @Kiln_finance](https://twitter.com/Kiln_finance).

Someone should also let them know Solana ain't Cardano on the [Cardano Staking Page](https://www.kiln.fi/protocols/cardano):

Looks like they care as much about Cardano as their pool pledge reflects.

    - 42.5 Million ADA staked...this is no puppy



## What We're Watching: The Power of ISPO Pools

- FAX ISPO, do a deeper dive 
    - Amazing how fast it filled up. Warrants some attention. 
    - Trend to expect for Cardano Degen Token and NFT summer?
    - Expect more ADA dumping to fiat?
    - Lecture on ISPOs not all that great because dumps ADA to Fiat to pay for employees. 
    - What pools did the delegation come from? Anything notable? 
- FAX went so quickly, AXO MAL ISPO (look into) - major black holes that quickly suck in utility. Maybe a lot comes from exchanges searching for the next big token. Perhaps necessary evil because when they close, stake migrated elsewhere.

- Spectrum Finance ISPO
    - SpectrumFi (formerly ErgoDEX) launching cross-chain to Cardano and pursuing an ISPO
    - https://twitter.com/SpectrumLabs_/status/1650565473967194113?s=20 
    - They are open source everything and have a steadfast grassroots community. We’ll keep an eye on these potential pools.
- Iagon ISPO
- Goofy Goofers (h/t Bison)
    - Goofy Gophers Mining Club, GGMC
    - Keep your eyes peeled for any new pools looking like this: https://twitter.com/GGMC_nft/status/1650249711129968640?s=20
    - Goofy Gophers Mining Club | SOLD OUT on Twitter - Twitter
    - “Miners have started to arrive in Iowa ⛏️ Soon, they'll be working day and night to power the GGMC and pour liquidity into #ADA ☀️🌙 #UtilityCNFT”
    - Hat tip to Bison Coin for this: https://twitter.com/bisoncoin_io/status/1650250966216896514?s=20 (use this tweet in the article embedded pic)
- Reverse ISPO flood from rumors of Frosty and team implosion? Smells of a staking bank run in the making. 
- Total staked dropping to high 67%, DeFi offering better returns? (h/t LiberLion article)
    - Something to keep an eye on, as DeFi ramps up, and TVL, does Staking % go down? If folks can get a better return in DeFi than Staking (which will only go down over time as reserve rewards diminish)…https://twitter.com/liberlion17/status/1649378719046197258?s=20 

## BALANCE Updates

### CF Delegation Grant for BALNC Round 2

We thank the Cardano Foundation for another round of Delegation Grant to BALNC Pool! This makes round two. We are very fortunate, thank the CF, and will build more community charts!

You can see the full list of current CF delegation pools on Pool.pm [here](https://pool.pm/cf/stake).

### The Pool Group Public API Updated to Include Pool Tickers

In our last pool landscape report, the great STR8 pool community requested if the [Public BALANCE Pool Group API](https://www.balanceanalytics.io/api/groupdata.json) could be updated to include pool tickers.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Might I suggest to add a third attribute &quot;pool_ticker&quot; next to &quot;pool_hash&quot; and &quot;pool_group&quot; to double check and validate the list and for more human-readability?</p>&mdash; Straight Pool,💧 (@Straightpool4) <a href="https://twitter.com/Straightpool4/status/1648315608558186497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It's not a bad idea, and we are delighted to [announce that the update has been incorporated](https://twitter.com/BalanceData22/status/1650356131649273857?s=20)!

Don't forget to bookmark the API, share it freely, and suggest more requests.

Enjoy: https://www.balanceanalytics.io/api/groupdata.json

### New BALANCE Rack Server Dedicated to DB-Sync
More great news: as the Pool Node and DB-Sync storage requirements are quickly on the rise, we have provisioned for future growth and performance and have procured and installed a ***new rack server dedicated to DB-Sync and BALANCE On-chain Analytics.***

We are making big upgrades to exceed current and future hardware requirements by at least 1.5x using the best-in-class technology. DB-Sync has been successfully re-spooled up and 100% synced with the blockchain tip!

We'll have more pool and DB-Sync information coming to our website pool page in the future. There is too much building for now, but you'll be impressed with the bare-metal setup, for sure.

By the way, have you noticed the quiet jump in the minimum RAM size requirement for Cardano Node from 16 to 24GB with the latest [1.35.7 release](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.35.7)? It's definitely increasing rapidly. Pay attention, folks. Have your pools been impacted? Many small pools perhaps will be in the coming 1-2 years (gulp).

### BALNC Pool Eternl Now Ranked #46!
With the updated pledge from 300kAda to 400kAda, we are now super thankful and proud of our high pool ranking in [Eternl Wallet](https://eternl.io/app/mainnet/welcome) of #46.

Eternl uses a pool ranking scheme based not just on performance and reliability, but also values and weighs pledge ***much more*** than Daedalus. We believe they also downrank multipools too based on how many. We wish they would open source the scheme!

Pool ranking actually has a powerful psychological impact. For instance, we are ranked #46 in Eternl but only #541 in Daedalus as of Epoch 408. This is obviously a wide margin based on what is valued and weight ranked. We should have easy-to-understand and find assumptions to aid in decision-making.

### BALNC Pool Passes 200 Blocks!

BALNCE Pool has surpassed _200 Blocks!_ A new personal record, and many more to come strengthening the network.
