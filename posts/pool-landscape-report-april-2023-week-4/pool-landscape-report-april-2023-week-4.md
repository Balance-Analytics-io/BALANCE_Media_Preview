- [Nick] Found a Cardanians [CRDNS] private pool big boy of 42.5 Million.
    - Hmm..just reviewing some of the old pools with high saturation and came across this private pool:(edited)
    - https://cardanoscan.io/pool/e069112add6af5fa1a11a1716357de1848c22229eb2eaa007702d5c9?tab=epochhistory 
    - https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool1up53z2kadt6l5xs359ckx477rpyvyg3favh25qrhqt2ujclpq3h/about#data (to see cardanians relays)
    - Appears to be part of the Cardanians group based on relay data(edited)
    - 42.5 Million ADA staked...this is no puppy
- FAX ISPO, do a deeper dive 
    - Amazing how fast it filled up. Warrants some attention. 
    - Trend to expect for Cardano Degen Token and NFT summer?
    - Expect more ADA dumping to fiat?
    - Lecture on ISPOs not all that great because dumps ADA to Fiat to pay for employees. 
    - What pools did the delegation come from? Anything notable? 
- Dig into Binance stake what happened to it?
- BALANCE Pool Group API updated
    - Pool ticker name is now included per community request

4/22/23
- [Garant] Something to keep an eye on, as DeFi ramps up, and TVL, does Staking % go down? If folks can get a better return in DeFi than Staking (which will only go down over time as reserve rewards diminish)‚Ä¶https://twitter.com/liberlion17/status/1649378719046197258?s=20 

4/21/23
- [Garant] CF Whales migrated. Glean any insights from the old to new pools.

4/20/23
- [Garant] NMKR went from 1M pledge to 800k. They went 99% margin private 3 months ago. Interesting did not know they had a pool. Glad it‚Äôs single. Is it a company treasury or savings account? The next MicroStrategy, going Ada Standard? 











## The Power of ISPOs Pools
Single ITN Pools spooling down, multiple ISPO and Exchange pools are spooling up.
- FAX went so quickly, AXO MAL ISPO (look into) - major black holes that quickly suck in utility. Maybe a lot comes from exchanges searching for the next big token. Perhaps necessary evil because when they close, stake migrated elsewhere.

## What We're Watching
- SpectrumFi ISPO
- Iagon ISPO
- Goofy Goofers (h/t Bison)
- Reverse ISPO flood from rumors of Frosty and team implosion? Smells of a staking bank run in the making. 
- Total staked dropping to high 67%, DeFi offering better returns? (h/t LiberLion article)

## BALANCE Updates

### The Pool Group Public API Updated to Include Pool Tickers

In our last pool landscape report, the great STR8 pool community requested if the [Public BALANCE Pool Group API](https://www.balanceanalytics.io/api/groupdata.json) could be updated to include pool tickers.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Might I suggest to add a third attribute &quot;pool_ticker&quot; next to &quot;pool_hash&quot; and &quot;pool_group&quot; to double check and validate the list and for more human-readability?</p>&mdash; Straight Pool,üíß (@Straightpool4) <a href="https://twitter.com/Straightpool4/status/1648315608558186497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It's not a bad idea, and we are delighted to announce that the update has been incorporated!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello!! Great news! The BALANCE pool group data API has been updated to include pool ticker. Enjoy!!</p>&mdash; BALANCE (@BalanceData22) <a href="https://twitter.com/BalanceData22/status/1650356131649273857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Don't forget to bookmark the API, share it freely, and suggest more requests.

Enjoy: https://www.balanceanalytics.io/api/groupdata.json

### New BALANCE Rack Server Dedicated to DB-Sync
More great news: as the Pool Node and DB-Sync storage requirements are quickly on the rise, we have provisioned for future growth and performance and have procured and installed a ***new rack server dedicated to DB-Sync and BALANCE On-chain Analytics.***

We are making big upgrades to exceed current and future hardware requirements by at least 1.5x using the best-in-class technology. DB-Sync has been successfully re-spooled up and 100% synced with the blockchain tip!

We'll have more pool and DB-Sync information coming to our website pool page in the future. There is too much building for now, but you'll be impressed with the bare-metal setup, for sure.

By the way, have you noticed the quiet jump in the minimum RAM size requirement for Cardano Node from 16 to 24GB with the latest [1.35.7 release](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/tag/1.35.7)? It's definitely increasing rapidly. Pay attention, folks. Have your pools been impacted? Many small pools perhaps will be in the coming 1-2 years (gulp).

### BALNC Pool Eternl Now Ranked #46!
With the updated pledge from 300kAda to 400kAda, we are now super thankful and proud of our high pool ranking in [Eternl Wallet](https://eternl.io/app/mainnet/welcome) of #46.

Eternl uses a pool ranking scheme based not just on performance and reliability, but also values and weighs pledge ***much more*** than Daedalus. We believe they also downrank multipools too based on how many. We wish they would open source the scheme!

Pool ranking actually has a powerful psychological impact. For instance, we are ranked #46 in Eternl but only #541 in Daedalus as of Epoch 408. This is obviously a wide margin based on what is valued and weight ranked. We should have easy-to-understand and find assumptions to aid in decision-making.

### BALNC Pool Passes 200 Blocks!

BALNCE Pool has surpassed _200 Blocks!_ A new personal record, and many more to come strengthening the network.
