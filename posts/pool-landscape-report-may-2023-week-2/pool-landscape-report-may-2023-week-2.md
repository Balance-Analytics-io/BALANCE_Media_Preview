## Pool Landscape Updates
**(4/30/23 Epoch 409 -> 5/15/23 Epoch 411)**
**More New Multi-Pools, Big Binance Stake Drop, NEW GIRL Gone?, Staked Ada Dropping**

Welcome back to the BALANCE Stake Pool Landscape Report. Here's the big macro picture of what has changed.

### Fifteen (15) New Pools have been Created - ~50% are MPOs
Since the last report (April 30th), fifteen (15) new pools have been created. 
- Over 50% of the new pools created (this round) are part of Multi-Pool Operations (MPOs).
    - WAVE added 1 new pool(s).
    - KID added 2 new pools.
    - MS added 1 new pool.
    - BD added 1 new pool.
    - New pool group SIMBA with 3 pools - same DNS used for relays.
    
### Huge Binance Stake Drop by 55% (1.57BAda)!
There was a significant drop in the Binance group stake, 1.57 Billion (yes, with a B) Ada, resulting in a decrease of 55% of their Live Stake - That's huge! 
- Where did the Ada go? Maybe some wallet sleuths can help. Are they positioning for SEC crackdowns or selling to cover costs?
- K-effective impacts and MAV increased significantly, see for yourself! MAV is now 27.

See for yourself. Here's a demo of searching for Binance Group and seeing the change from the last 10ish Epochs:

Here's a demo of seeing the increase in MAV and K-Effective! What's good to see is the K-Effective, a weighted measure of the pool groups, increasing rapidly. The only question remaining, where is the stake going?

### NEW GIRL dead? (335MAda Private Pool, all pledge, 100% margin)
In Epoch 411's analysis, it was very interesting to see the NEW GIRL private pool group's Live Stake effectively dropped to zero.
- In the Epoch 411 analysis, it's interesting to see NEW GIRL attempt to respawn under different POOL IDs.
- ADA was moved through the same stake address within minutes through the same utility.
- Given this finding, the NEW GIRL pool group is re-established using the new pool hash ID values. It appears that new pool IDs and new addresses are being used.
- Even if the funds were indeed a change in ownership, we still believe this to be a legitimate Multi-Pool Operation.



## Noteworthy Community Updates

The work is being done by [@@MicheleHarmonic](https://twitter.com/MicheleHarmonic) whose twitter bio reads "ecentralization first - @hlabs_tech founder - creator of @plu_ts". [ARMN](https://cexplorer.io/pool/pool19gzu2dyp0g9e0nsvtg34fdhrtgr8c5jq37nscalqkh3hsjmas69#performance) is Baremetel, “A pool that supports decentralization through the creation of utility software, running on bare metal servers” (Source:  https://harmonicpool.on.fleek.co/).  The pool is Part of the Cardano Single Pool Alliances. Nice work!

- GURU pool increased their minFee from 340 -> 813Ada and 0%. Not a bad move. Their pool rewards teeter between 500-800, so they should get more rewards but perhaps better pool ranking with 0% margin fee. It’s good to see someone making moves and coming off 340Ada.

- Djed reserve ratio has been under 400%, 360% on 5/8/23 - does this have any staked ADA impacts? Is SHEN Staked yet?


## BALANCE Updates
- In the trenches working on more charts. The Svelte + D3 learning curve is steep, and little references, but once over the hump, more charts should flow faster.
- The Public Pool Group API is starting to get hits, pretty nice grwoth metric! (pic)
