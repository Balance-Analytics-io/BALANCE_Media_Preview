Not only that, they stole [BrotherShip Pool's](https://twitter.com/BrothershipPool) Ticker **BSP**!

Perhaps the best we can do is make some social media noise by engaging with this tweet by [Pool.pm](pool.pm)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In a selfish &amp; careless move, <a href="https://twitter.com/binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@binance</a> has just created 32 pools with the BSP ticker already used by <a href="https://twitter.com/BrothershipPool?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BrothershipPool</a> since the very first day of the Shelley era 3 years ago.<a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cz_binance</a>, it shows a deep lack of care for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cardano?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Cardano</a> staking space from you company, please react! <a href="https://t.co/qSdYgBgAv7">pic.twitter.com/qSdYgBgAv7</a></p>&mdash; pool.pm (@pool_pm) <a href="https://twitter.com/pool_pm/status/1663809731603906560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
