## Pool Landscape Updates

**(5/15/23 Epoch 411 -> 05/30/23 Epoch 415)**

**Binance is Back with New Pools, A Call To Action for Pool Re-Delegation, Cardano Foundation Reward Sharing Scheme Polel Results, BALNC Pool with 4.88% ROS Last Epoch!**

Welcome back to the BALANCE Stake Pool Landscape Report. Here's the big macro picture of what has changed since last time.

### Eight (8) New Pools, New MPO FIGMENT, NEW GIRL Scoop

Since 5/15/23 Epoch 411, the following pool actions have taken place: 

- Eight (8) new pools were created since the last pool group dataset review/update.

- One (1) pool belongs to the [IDP](https://pool.pm/b9ffb01687eb9f12433a6edec90d808b75f9bde51ab2495d278d7727), which is [IDO PASS DAO](https://idopass.finance/index.html#). From their website:

    > "IDO PASS DAO is a Launchpad, DAO, Incubator, On-Chain Mapping. IDO Pass DAO is the first Cardano DAO to focus on IDOs, launchpads, and Blue chip CNFT fractionalization."

- [FIGMENT](https://figment.io/) is a new pool group forming, with two (2) pools so far. They are an institutional staking-as-a-service company that honestly has a very sophisticated website. It reminds me of Vanguard's style. From their website:

    > "Digital Asset Staking Built for Institutions. The complete staking solution for 200+ institutional clients, including asset managers, custodians, exchanges, foundations, and wallets, to earn rewards on their digital assets."

    - It's interesting how these VC Staking Services, or Staking Pools as a Service (SPaaS), are emerging with new lingo. Cardano, despite its top 10 market cap, is listed at the bottom. Go figure.

    - Regardless, it's good to see Cardano joining their service group and API. Maybe we should welcome them and let them know we agree there are no risks to staking and how much better it is than Ethereum...also that Community Delegation is the better option.

- One (1) existing pool was added to the NEW GIRL group (the pool has approximately 51 mADA). This is a very curious development, with NEW GIRL creating new pools and group activity.

***Note: If you are curious exactly which pools, you'll need to join the Matrix Group Edits Chat to find out. See below.***




 ### Huge Drop in Staked Ada on May 18th
 
 On May 18th there was a pretty big drop in Staked Ada! This was attributed to Binance continuing to de-stake Ada. But then, a few days later, a pretty decent U-Turn? What is going on?

### Binance is Back with New Pools for K=1000!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">annnd Binance is back. New Pools fully configured for k=1000.<br><br>hat tip to <a href="https://twitter.com/earncoinpool?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@earncoinpool</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KpunToN00b?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KpunToN00b</a> (Homer J AAA) in our Matrix Group Edits Chat! <br><br>All are welcome to join &amp; help be an On-Chain <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cardano?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Cardano</a> Guardians (dm for a username).<a href="https://t.co/9gCb4iD0g0">https://t.co/9gCb4iD0g0</a> <a href="https://t.co/1b2Q5VmGAf">pic.twitter.com/1b2Q5VmGAf</a></p>&mdash; BALANCE (@BalanceData22) <a href="https://twitter.com/BalanceData22/status/1663720822937190401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So Binance is back. They still have their 64 BNP Pools, but low and behold they are creating new pools for K=1000 (or 32MAda) configuration. Insider tip offs, or smart and proactive?

Regardless, the new pools stole our friend [BrotherShip Pool's](https://twitter.com/BrothershipPool) Ticker **BSP**! How rude. Now, how will people know who is the real BSP of the Cardano Single Pool Alliance.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Will the real slim shady, please stand up... <a href="https://t.co/D64IPsPvem">pic.twitter.com/D64IPsPvem</a></p>&mdash; BALANCE (@BalanceData22) <a href="https://twitter.com/BalanceData22/status/1663714167021355008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Perhaps the best we can do is make some social media noise by engaging with this tweet by [Pool.pm](pool.pm).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In a selfish &amp; careless move, <a href="https://twitter.com/binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@binance</a> has just created 32 pools with the BSP ticker already used by <a href="https://twitter.com/BrothershipPool?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BrothershipPool</a> since the very first day of the Shelley era 3 years ago.<a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cz_binance</a>, it shows a deep lack of care for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cardano?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Cardano</a> staking space from you company, please react! <a href="https://t.co/qSdYgBgAv7">pic.twitter.com/qSdYgBgAv7</a></p>&mdash; pool.pm (@pool_pm) <a href="https://twitter.com/pool_pm/status/1663809731603906560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## BALANCE Updates

### The BALNC Pool Seeing Great Rewards Lately: 4.9% ROS for Epoch 414!
The BALNC Pool has been experiencing amazing rewards lately! For the last Epoch 414, we achieved a 4.9% Return On Stake (ROS), and over the past four (4) epochs, we achieved a 3.9% ROS!

{% img src="balnc_epoch414_ros.png" alt="balnc_epoch414_ros" %}

No longer is there a low ROS excuse to not delegate with us. Aside from the BALANCE Web App service we provide, the BALNC pool is hot!

Sidenote: Have you noticed that with the drop in Binance Stake and overall Staked Ada decreasing from 70% to 60%, it has resulted in more blocks won for your pool?

If you think about it, despite having the same number of pools, there is now less Staked Ada and more block supply available to mint. With an increase in block supply and a decrease in demand, it becomes easier for small single pools to win a blockâ€”effectively causing a difficulty drop (using Bitcoin mining terms).

### Call to Action: Audit our Pool Group API and Join our Matrix Group Edits Chat
We would like to call for an audit of our Public Pool Group API and invite you to let us know if there are any mistakes. All suggestions are welcomed.

Join us in the Group Edits Chat Room in our Matrix Balance Space! Become an On-Chain Cardano Guardian. Alternatively, you can DM us on Twitter.
