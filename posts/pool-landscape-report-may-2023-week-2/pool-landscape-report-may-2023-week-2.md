## Pool Landscape Updates
**(4/30/23 Epoch 409 -> 5/15/23 Epoch 411)**
**More New Multi-pools, Big Binance Stake Drop, NEW GIRL Gone?, Staked Ada Dropping**

- 15 new pools created since last “pool groups” dataset update
- Over 50% of new pools created (this round) are part of multi-pool operations
    - *UPBIT added 5 new pool(s) (*I noticed this while checking pool.pm 10 total pools and covered this in the last newsletter, therefore subtracting 5 pools from the total)
    - WAVE added 1 new pool(s)
    - KID added 2 new pool(s)
    - MS added 1 new pool(s)
    - BD added 1 new pool(s)
    - Created new pool group SIMBA with 3 pools - same DNS used for relays
- Huge Binance Stake drop!
    - Where did it go?
    - K-effective impacts and MAV!
- NEW GIRL dead? Live Stake effectively dropped to zero.
Just reviewed the chart data for epoch 411, interesting to see NEW GIRL attempt to respawn under different POOL IDs.
In doing more investigation into the NEW GIRL pool group issue, I found that the ADA was moved through the same stake address within minutes.  Given this finding, I will re-establish the NEW GIRL pool group using the new pool hash ID values. Looks like new pool IDs and new addresses, but all moved within minutes apart through the same utility. Even if the funds were indeed a change in ownership, I still believe this to be a multi-pool operation.

- GURU pool increased their minFee from 340 -> 813Ada and 0%. Not a bad move. Their pool rewards teeter between 500-800, so they should get more rewards but perhaps better pool ranking with 0% margin fee. It’s good to see someone making moves and coming off 340Ada.

    - Has DeFi and the Memecoin mania resulted in less staked Ada… or are Exchanges Unstaking?

## Single Pool Spotlight: TERM and COSD
Both extremely erudite, steadfast, and kind Cardano Community members diligently contributing to CIPS, Cardano Forums, and Cardano Professional Society in the Matrix. Not only that, their stake pools are shining examples of Good Actors in the landscape. Kudos to both and thank you for all that you do.
