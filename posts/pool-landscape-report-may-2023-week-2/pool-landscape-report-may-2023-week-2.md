## Pool Landscape Updates
**(4/30/23 Epoch 409 -> 5/15/23 Epoch 411)**
**More New Multi-Pools, Big Binance Stake Drop, NEW GIRL Gone?, Staked Ada Dropping**

Welcome back to the BALANCE Stake Pool Landscape Report. Here's the big macro picture of what has changed.

### Fifteen (15) New Pools have been Created - ~50% are MPOs
Since the last report (April 30th), fifteen (15) new pools have been created. 
- Over 50% of the new pools created (this round) are part of Multi-Pool Operations (MPOs).
    - WAVE added 1 new pool(s).
    - KID added 2 new pools.
    - MS added 1 new pool.
    - BD added 1 new pool.
    - New pool group SIMBA with 3 pools - same DNS used for relays.
    
### Huge Binance Stake Drop by 55% (1.57BAda)!
There was a significant drop in the Binance group stake, 1.57 Billion (yes, with a B) Ada, resulting in a decrease of 55% of their Live Stake - That's huge! 
- Where did the Ada go? Maybe some wallet sleuths can help. Are they positioning for SEC crackdowns or selling to cover costs?
- K-effective impacts and MAV increased significantly, see for yourself! MAV is now 27.

See for yourself. Here's a demo of searching for Binance Group and seeing the change from the last 10ish Epochs:

Here's a demo of seeing the increase in MAV and K-Effective! What's good to see is the K-Effective, a weighted measure of the pool groups, increasing rapidly. The only question remaining, where is the stake going?

### NEW GIRL dead? (335MAda Private Pool, all pledge, 100% margin)
In Epoch 411's analysis, it was very interesting to see the NEW GIRL private pool group's Live Stake effectively dropped to zero.
- In the Epoch 411 analysis, it's interesting to see NEW GIRL attempt to respawn under different POOL IDs.
- ADA was moved through the same stake address within minutes through the same utility.
- Given this finding, the NEW GIRL pool group is re-established using the new pool hash ID values. It appears that new pool IDs and new addresses are being used.
- Even if the funds were indeed a change in ownership, we still believe this to be a legitimate Multi-Pool Operation.

    - Their pool rewards teeter between 500-800, so they should get more rewards but perhaps better pool ranking with 0% margin fee. It‚Äôs good to see someone making moves and coming off 340Ada, and it makes sense!

    - [Jack](https://twitter.com/jackfriks/status/1655231010823622659?s=20) has great contributions to Cardano education and onboarding new users. He also provided valient contributions to decentralization. Best of luck in whatever you pursue!

## Single Pool Spotlight: TERM and COSD
Both extremely erudite, steadfast, and kind Cardano Community members diligently contributing to CIPS, Cardano Forums, and Cardano Professional Society in the Matrix. Not only that, their stake pools are shining examples of Good Actors in the landscape. Kudos to both and thank you for all that you do.

## What We‚Äôre Paying Attention To
- Cardano Foundation SPO On-Chain Poll for Stake Pool Reward Sharing Scheme (RSS) Parameters.
    - A lot of rekindled discussion on twitter.
    - What do you think will happen? Pro tip: watch the Coinbase stake pools for the answer.

- Djed reserve ratio has been under 400%, 360% on 5/8/23 - does this have any staked ADA impacts? Is SHEN Staked yet?


## BALANCE Updates
- We are inn the trenches working on more charts. The Svelte + D3 learning curve is steep, and little open-source references, but once over the hump, more charts should flow faster.
- The Public Pool Group API is starting to get hits, pretty nice grwoth metric! (pic)
