## Pool Landscape Updates
**(4/30/23 Epoch 409 -> 5/15/23 Epoch 411)**
**More New Multi-pools, Big Binance Stake Drop, NEW GIRL Gone?, Staked Ada Dropping**

Welcome back to the BALANCE Stake Pool Landscape Report. Here's the big macro picture of what changed.

### Fifteen (15) new pools have been created since last “pool groups” dataset update (April 30th, 2023).
- Over 50% of new pools created (this round) are part of Multi-Pool Operations (MPOs).
    - WAVE added 1 new pool(s)
    - KID added 2 new pool(s)
    - MS added 1 new pool(s)
    - BD added 1 new pool(s)
    - New pool group SIMBA with 3 pools - same DNS used for relays
### Huge Binance Stake drop by 55% (1.57BAda)!
    - Where did it go? Maybe some walelt slueths can help.
    - K-effective impacts and MAV increases!
### NEW GIRL dead? Live Stake effectively dropped to zero...(335MAda Private Pool, all pledge, 100% margin)
    - Epoch 411 analysis, it's interesting to see NEW GIRL attempt to respawn under different POOL IDs.
    - ADA was moved through the same stake address within minute through the same utility.
    - Given this finding, the NEW GIRL pool group is re-established using the new pool hash ID values. Looks like new pool IDs and new addresses, but . 
    - Even if the funds were indeed a change in ownership, we still believe this to be a legit Multi-Pool Operation.

- GURU pool increased their minFee from 340 -> 813Ada and 0%. Not a bad move. Their pool rewards teeter between 500-800, so they should get more rewards but perhaps better pool ranking with 0% margin fee. It’s good to see someone making moves and coming off 340Ada.

- Djed reserve ratio has been under 400%, 360% on 5/8/23 - does this have any staked ADA impacts? Is SHEN Staked yet?


## BALANCE Updates
- In the trenches working on more charts. The Svelte + D3 learning curve is steep, and little references, but once over the hump, more charts should flow faster.
- The Public Pool Group API is starting to get hits, pretty nice grwoth metric! (pic)
